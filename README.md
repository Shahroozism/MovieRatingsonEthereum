# MovieRatingsonEthereum

This small project takes Ethereum as our blockchain platform to make a movie rating application featuring only three movies using React, solidity, truffle, and Web3.js. 

Setting up Environment:

npm install -g truffle

npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc

mkdir movieRatingApp //make a project directory

cd movieRatingApp


mkdir rating // backend folder

cd rating 

truffle init //initialize a new truffle project 

This will create necessary files and folders to create and deploy smart contracts.
